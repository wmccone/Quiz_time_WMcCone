# Quiz_time_WMcCone
This is the Homework 4 of the UTA coding Bootcamp.

The goal is to create functioning quiz with a timer element and a scoring element. The question should show one at a time and use buttons to move the quiz forward. The quiz should have a high score section at the end and should be able to save the score to local storage
